Description
This program is a chatbot that helps people learn how to stay safe online. 
You can talk to it like a real person and ask questions about things like strong passwords, phishing, malware, and more. 
It can also help you create tasks, set reminders, and quiz you to test your knowledge about cybersecurity. 
The chatbot keeps a list of everything it helps you with, like tasks and quiz scores, so you can check what youâ€™ve done anytime.
